Jun 2
branch fix1:
FIXED 1. conversation didn't close correct with <END_OF_CALL>
FIXED 2. Add chainlit WEB
FIXED 7. Make Chroma DB faster, save it to the disk during the fist run.
FIXED 8. Add smith Langchain tracking for GPT cost calculation.

NEED TO FIX:
3. Send support requests - it is empty tool without doing something
4. No any evaluation process was made, and I still can't image it without special dataset for this task.
5. Not checked deployment process with docker and alternative poetry environment.
6. Not checked logging process.
9. Rebuild with LangGraph to 2 non-stop loops: first for general sales process, second - for product details.
